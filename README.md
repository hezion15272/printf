  - [Group Projects](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/111)
  - [Flowcharts](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/130)
  - [Approaching a Project](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/350)
# Requirements
## General
  - All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
# Description
This is a team project with participants [**Hezekiah Ibok**](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/link_trackings/click?to=eyJpIjo2OTEsInUiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vaGV6aW9uMTUyNzIifQ%3D%3D) and **Korede Korede Babatunde.** 
The aim of this project is to develop a function _ _printf_ that replicates the C standard library printf() function.
  - How to apply variadic functions to compile big data project
  - Understand the complexities of the output function printf()
  - Making use of the different forms of algorithms to solve complex problems
  - And how to work as a team
 # Tasks
 ## mandatory
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life

Write a function that produces output according to a format.

Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
  - You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
    - c
    - s
    - %
